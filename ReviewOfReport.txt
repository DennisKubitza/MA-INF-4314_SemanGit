General
=======

- Including a screeshot of the ontology representation with WebVOWL would be great. (As far as I remember you can extract .svg from it)


Proposed Approach
=================

- having here (5.2.1) a screenshot of the ontology in WebVOWL would be great.
- having an except of the ontology would be great too. (maybe you could add the full file also in Appendix)
- apparently 5.3 is not finished yet ;-)


Evaluation
==========

- 6.1 results are *very* interesting. (Maybe, you could also add some time performance specifying your machines, like 'how long took the process depending on the base?'â€¦)
- 6.2 is not finished yet ;-)


Conclusions and Future Work
===========================

- Not finished yet ;-)


Biblio.
=======

- What is the recommended style? (If you choose to move to LLNCS, you should then use the one they also provide, to do so, you'll have to add an additional file to the project which defines all the styles.)
