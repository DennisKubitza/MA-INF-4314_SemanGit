General
=======

- Including a screeshot of the ontology representation with WebVOWL would be great. (As far as I remember you can extract .svg from it)


Background
==========

- You should add a reference to "The RDF Primer" at the first RDF occurrence.
- More generally, this section has lot's of overlap with the Intro. so, if necessary, the Intro. could be shortened a bit, letting the information here.


Use Cases
=========

- You used female gender in the examples! *Very Good*


Related Work
============

- A bit short, but nonetheless well constructed. :-)


Proposed Approach
=================

- s/chapter/section/g
- add ";" when itemizing in 5.1
- 5.2 should be renamed since it shares its name with 5
- s/"git user"/``git user''/
- could you add a ref for the OOPS in 5.2.1?
- there is an official reference for WebVOWL you should use, I think it is this one:
	@inproceedings{lohmann2014webvowl,
	  title={WebVOWL: Web-based visualization of ontologies},
	  author={Lohmann, Steffen and Link, Vincent and Marbach, Eduard and Negru, Stefan},
	  booktitle={International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management},
	  pages={154--158},
	  year={2014},
	  organization={Springer}
	}
- having here (5.2.1) a screenshot of the ontology in WebVOWL would be great.
- having an except of the ontology would be great too. (maybe you could add the full file also in Appendix)
- apparently 5.3 is not finished yet ;-)


Evaluation
==========

- 6.1 results are *very* interesting. (Maybe, you could also add some time performance specifying your machines, like 'how long took the process depending on the base?'â€¦)
- 6.2 is not finished yet ;-)


Conclusions and Future Work
===========================

- Not finished yet ;-)


Biblio.
=======

- What is the recommended style? (If you choose to move to LLNCS, you should then use the one they also provide, to do so, you'll have to add an additional file to the project which defines all the styles.)
